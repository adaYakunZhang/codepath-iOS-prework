# App Brainstorming
#### My favorite 3 applications with features:
- Instagram: a popular social media app
  
  1. Photo and Video Sharing: Instagram allows users to upload and share photos and videos with their followers. Users can apply various filters, edits, and captions to their posts before sharing them. The platform is known for its emphasis on visual content.
  2. Stories: Instagram Stories is a feature that lets users share photos and videos that disappear after 24 hours. Users can add text, stickers, GIFs, and interactive elements to their Stories. This feature is widely used for sharing temporary and more casual updates.
  3. Explore Page: The Explore page on Instagram helps users discover new content based on their interests and interactions. It suggests posts, photos, and videos from accounts that a user might not be following but could be interested in. This feature encourages discovery and engagement beyond a user's immediate network.
- Snackpass: a mobile app that focuses on facilitating food ordering, pickup, and social engagement at local restaurants and eateries.
  
  1. Mobile Ordering and Pickup: Snackpass allows users to place food orders from their favorite local restaurants directly through the app. Users can browse menus, customize their orders, and make payments within the app. The app streamlines the ordering process and provides a convenient way for users to pick up their orders without waiting in line.
  2. Social Integration and Gifting: One of Snackpass's unique features is its social integration. Users can connect with friends on the app, send and receive food items as gifts, and participate in group orders. This social aspect adds a fun and interactive element to the food ordering experience, allowing users to share meals and surprises with their network.
- TikTok: a social media platform that allows users to create, share, and discover short-form videos set to music or audio clips.
  
  1. Short-Form Video Creation: TikTok enables users to create and edit short videos typically ranging from 15 to 60 seconds in length. Users can record videos, apply various effects, add music, and use a variety of creative tools to enhance their content.
  2. Music and Sound Integration: One of TikTok's standout features is its extensive library of licensed music and audio clips. Users can select from a wide range of songs, sound effects, and dialogues to add to their videos, allowing for creative synchronization and storytelling.
